      <description>Simona’s presentation can be found here: http://www.r-gators.com/pdf/wildlife-tracking-data.pdf
The RData file and RMarkdown file (used to make the rest of this post) can be downloaded at the GitHub repository here https://github.com/ufrmeetup/picardi. If you’re unfamiliar GitHub, you can download a zipped file by pressing the green “Clone or download” button on the right of that page. From there just unzip the folder and click on the .Rproj file (requires RStudio to be installed).</description>

      <description>Check out Dr. Zhao’s presentation: http://www.r-gators.com/slides/zhao. This presentation was made using RMarkdown. The Markdown code is included below, however outputs from R (i.e. graphs) will only be displayed in the presentation.
Download the RMarkdown file and an R script for generating data to test these scripts at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ufrmeetup/zhao. Note the RMarkdown script relies on some private data, so it will not run on it’s own, but can be run using the simulated data.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will be talking about the importance of cross-validation to choose the best model. To do this, we will show:
the problem of using simple in-sample metrics for model selection with a univariate example the problem of using simple in-sample metrics for model selection with a multivariable example how to perform cross-validation using simple linear regression and some problems associated with this  1) The problem of using simple in-sample metrics for model seelction with a univariate example When dealing with a regression model, we are often interested in determining which covariates to keep in the model and which to through away.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is an introductory post into using Bookdown. Bookdown is a powerful package that allows you to create documents embedding images, tables, and code. One great reason to use Bookdown is that you can put results and images from your code directly into your text, which reduces the chances of copying errors. For this post, I’m going to focus on creating an HTML document, though you can also create outputs in Word and PDF formats.</description>

  Introduction to using for loops What Are Loops? “Looping”, “cycling”, “iterating” or just replicating instructions is an old practice that originated well before the invention of computers. It is nothing more than automating a multi-step process by organizing sequences of actions or ‘batch’ processes and by grouping the parts that need to be repeated. All modern programming languages provide special constructs that allow for the repetition of instructions or blocks of instructions.</description>

 Reading CSV datafiles into R We often store our data in comma seperated value (CSV) files, which can be read into R using the read.csv() function:
# Download example .csv file download.file(&amp;quot;https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;data/portal_data_joined.csv&amp;quot;) # Save into variable surveys &amp;lt;- read.csv(&#39;data/portal_data_joined.csv&#39;)  Note: this code requires having a data/ folder in your project
Functions for characterizing dataframe We can run the name of the variable to view the dataframe, but often there will be too much information to display in the console</description>
