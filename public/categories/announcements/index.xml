      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the details for this week&amp;rsquo;s R meetup session:
Presentation: &amp;ldquo;Speeding up R code using Rcpp and foreach packages&amp;rdquo; by Dr Pedro Albuquerque Time: 4 to 6pm Date: Feb 8 (Wednesday) Venue: Marston Science Library Room L136
We think this week&amp;rsquo;s presentation topic will be very useful for those of us who have (or planning to write) R codes take up lots of computing power and time. By leveraging on C++, via Rcpp, and package such as foreach, it is possible to get your job done faster!</description>
