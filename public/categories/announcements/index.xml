      <description>We will be hosting an instructor training workshop for becoming certified as a Carpentries instructor on March 5-6, 2018 and we invite you to apply by Wednesday 2&amp;frasl;14. The purpose of the Carpentries organization, which is a merger between the pre-existing Software Carpentry (https://software-carpentry.org/) and Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/), is to run workshops that provide better computational skills to scientists, including in various programming languages.
The upcoming 2-day training workshop will train instructors to use educational pedagogy and best instructional practices while teaching technical subjects like programming and reproducible science.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the details for this week&amp;rsquo;s R meetup session:
Presentation: &amp;ldquo;Speeding up R code using Rcpp and foreach packages&amp;rdquo; by Dr Pedro Albuquerque Time: 4 to 6pm Date: Feb 8 (Wednesday) Venue: Marston Science Library Room L136
We think this week&amp;rsquo;s presentation topic will be very useful for those of us who have (or planning to write) R codes take up lots of computing power and time. By leveraging on C++, via Rcpp, and package such as foreach, it is possible to get your job done faster!</description>
