      <description>R is capable of creating a wide variety of graphics and data visualizations right out of the box. It’s one of the main reasons for using R. However, base R graphics are often not the most aesthetically pleasing, and can be diffuclt to customize (especially if you’re new to programs like R that don’t use graphic interfaces).
Thankfully there are many packages for making elegant data visualizations in R, and a standout among them is ggplot2.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the details for this week&amp;rsquo;s R meetup session:
Presentation: &amp;ldquo;Speeding up R code using Rcpp and foreach packages&amp;rdquo; by Dr Pedro Albuquerque Time: 4 to 6pm Date: Feb 8 (Wednesday) Venue: Marston Science Library Room L136
We think this week&amp;rsquo;s presentation topic will be very useful for those of us who have (or planning to write) R codes take up lots of computing power and time. By leveraging on C++, via Rcpp, and package such as foreach, it is possible to get your job done faster!</description>
