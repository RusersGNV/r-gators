We have resurrected the UF R list-serv to provide a forum for asking questions in R. Please sign up for the [list-serv here](http://tinyurl.com/UFRUser). If you want to manage how you recieve emails from the list, [follow this link](https://lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?INDEX). Sign in and change setting under the subscriber's corner.  We strive to make the list beginner-friendly, however please check out [this posting guide](http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html) before posting (well-formmated questions can be answered much quicker!).
