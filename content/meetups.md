Our weekly meetups are on Wednesdays from 4-6pm at the Marstons Science Library ([located here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/UF+Marston+Science+Library/@29.6480995,-82.3462533,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e8a39d475abd77:0xa84d77bf04354a1e!8m2!3d29.6480995!4d-82.3440646)). The meetups consist of presentation/tutorial covering interesting topics in R, and are followed by an open session where you can consult advanced R users. Please be sure to sign up for the list-serv for updates on topics and changes to the schedule/locations.

If you have suggestions for future presentations, or are interested in giving a presentation (even better!), please don't hesitate to [send us an email](mailto:jjmillar@ufl.edu%3Cmailto:jjmillar@ufl.edu). We're also striving to create R markdown files for these presentations, which will be hosted on this site and on Github.
