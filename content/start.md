#### Installing R and RStudio

- The first step is to [install R](https://www.r-project.org/), just select the correct link for your operating system

- Next, we **highly recommend** [installing RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). This is an "integrated development environment" (IDE), which provides a useful interface from programming in R. It's not essential, but it will make your life easier (especially for beginnings), and it's free!

- You're ready to start programming in R! Now you can sign up for the [UF R list-serv](../listserv), take a look at the [schedule](../schedule) for activities on campus, and check out the R-related [courses and workshops at UF](../courses)

- If you get stuck, attending the [weekly meetups](../meetups) is a great place to get one-on-one help!
