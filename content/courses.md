#### Workshops
The [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) workshops are a great way to jump-start your R programming skills. Workshops are offered regularly across campus, check out the [UF Informatics Institute website](https://informatics.institute.ufl.edu/) for upcoming workshops. 

Also, all of the course materials are freely available at any time, so you can work through these lessons on your own. The [Data Analysis and Visualization in R](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/) is a great place to start, and the [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) and [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) lessons provide more in-depth resources for mastering R. 


#### Data Carpentry Course
The Data Carpentry curriculum is also offered as a 3 credit course (WIS 6934) instructed by Dr. Ethan White. Here's a link to the [course website](http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/schedule/).


#### Stats Courses
Many department across UF have courses in statistics that use R (as well as other programs). [Check out this site](https://ufstatscourses.shinyapps.io/shiny_tutorial/) to see all the stats courses across campus, and which ones use R. 

#### Introduction to R for the Social Sciences Workshop series
