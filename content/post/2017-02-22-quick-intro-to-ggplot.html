<p>R is capable of creating a wide variety of graphics and data visualizations right out of the box. It’s one of the main reasons for using R. However, base R graphics are often not the most aesthetically pleasing, and can be diffuclt to customize (especially if you’re new to programs like R that don’t use graphic interfaces).</p>
<p>Thankfully there are many packages for making elegant data visualizations in R, and a standout among them is ggplot2. This package is among the most downloaded on CRAN, it won’t take long before you see ggplots everywhere.</p>
<p>First lets install and load the package,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(&#39;ggplot2&#39;)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s make a basic histogram using base graphics and ggplot. We’ll use the diamonds dataset (this is built into the package).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(diamonds$carat)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-02-22-quick-intro-to-ggplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-02-22-quick-intro-to-ggplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>These code for these graphics are similar, as are the outputs, however there are some noticeable differences.</p>
