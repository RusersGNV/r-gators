We will be hosting an instructor training workshop for becoming certified as a Carpentries instructor on March 5-6, 2018 and we invite you to apply by Wednesday 2/14. The purpose of the Carpentries organization, which is a merger between the pre-existing Software Carpentry (https://software-carpentry.org/) and Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/), is to run workshops that provide better computational skills to scientists, including in various programming languages. 

The upcoming 2-day training workshop will train instructors to use educational pedagogy and best instructional practices while teaching technical subjects like programming and reproducible science. This workshop focuses on the skill of teaching, no prior technical skills are needed. After the workshop you will have an understanding of what motivates learners, how to create inclusive environments, and how to form and assess knowledge. With an additional checkout process, certified instructors are able to teach two-day Carpentries brand workshops. There are opportunities to do so at UF, as at least half a dozen workshops are run each year by the UF Carpentries Club. Volunteer instructors are also always needed around the United States (paid travel) in the greater Carpentries community. 

There is more information about the workshop here: https://fmichonneau.github.io/2018-03-05-UF-ttt/. This workshop is open to everyone in the UF community, please distribute this information widely. 

If you are interested, please fill out the application at https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/. Include the code 2018-03-05-ttt-florida in the "Group name" box to specify the UF training, and you can ignore the information in the yellow box on the page. The deadline to fill out the application is the end of the day on Wednesday, February 14 and we will send out acceptance notifications February 16.
