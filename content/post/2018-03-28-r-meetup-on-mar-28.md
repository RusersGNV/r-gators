This weekâ€™s R meetup will be on Wednesday (Mar 28; 4-6pm) at Marston science library Room 136. In the first hour of the meetup (4-5pm), Justin will be giving a presentation on *the Shiny package in R*. Shiny allows R users to create interactive web application right from R without any knowledge of HTML/JavaScript/CSS. Shiny apps can be freely hosted on [www.shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io), and can have a wide range of potential uses. Shiny is a broad topic (way more than we could cover in a hour!), so this presentation will focus on the basics of Shiny, resources for learning Shiny, and some examples of Shiny apps. We will also have a demonstration of creating a simple app for some data exploration.

Thank you.
