Here's the details for this week's R meetup session:

Presentation: "Speeding up R code using Rcpp and foreach packages" by Dr Pedro Albuquerque
Time: 4 to 6pm
Date: Feb 8 (Wednesday)
Venue: Marston Science Library Room L136

We think this week's presentation topic will be very useful for those of us who have (or planning to write) R codes take up lots of computing power and time. By leveraging on C++, via Rcpp, and package such as foreach, it is possible to get your job done faster! And of course it's always interesting to take note on what R and its package can help you with, even if you don't have such problem currently.

As usual, you'll get to interact, help and get help from other R users after the presentation. Drinks will be provided, so please bring your computer, questions, and expertise! And please do not hesitate to contact me (kokbent@ufl.edu<mailto:kokbent@ufl.edu>) or Justin (jjmillar@ufl.edu<mailto:jjmillar@ufl.edu>) if you have any enquiry or feedback 

If you have friends and colleagues who wish to join the UF R users mailing list, fill in the form here<http://tinyurl.com/UFRUser> (http://tinyurl.com/UFRUser) or email us.

Also, please feel free to ask your R questions via this mailing list 

See you on Wednesday!
