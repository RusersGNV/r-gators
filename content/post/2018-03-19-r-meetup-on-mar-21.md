This week’s R meetup will be on Wednesday (Mar 21; 4-6pm) at Marston science library Room 136. *There will be no presentation for this R meetup.* So the meetup will be a two-hour “open lab” session and we invite everyone with R expertise or with R question/problem to hang out and we’ll help each other out. We also love to hear from you about what types of analyses/projects are interesting for you.
